# Description of each code file, and a recommandation in the order of opening it

The first file:
pp collision fitted.The goal was to read the data, create personnalized fitted function and plot them together.

Second file:
comparaison_fitting between the differents option to understand the behavious of the distribution as a function of pT.

Third file and fourth file:
I switch to the PbPb collision data to fit them after this, and then did the exp_fit extrapolation to get parameter and define uncertainties correctly

Fifth file;
The loop file is the programm of extrapolation in a function.

Sixth file: 
The last file is a try to fit with the blast wave model the Pb Pb datas.
