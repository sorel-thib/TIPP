# Description of each code file, and a recommandation in the order of opening it

The first file I did is pp collision fitted. The goal was to read the data, create personnalized fitted function and plot them together.

Then I did the comparaison_fitting between the differents option to understand the behavious of the distribution as a function of pT

I switch to the PbPb collision data to fit them after this, and then did the exp_fit extrapolation to get parameter and define uncertainties correctly

The loop file is the programm of extrapolation in a function.

The last file is a try to fit with the blast wave model the Pb Pb datas.
